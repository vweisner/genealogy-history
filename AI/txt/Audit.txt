Auditing Information for AIs

Section I. Auditing Information
- Auditing is the act of looking at the entire git repository to check on the status of the entire project.
- The AI would adapt auditing methods based on the limits of the AI used, the git repository tree, previous AI-user interactions, and what questions remain open in the entire project.

Section II. Auditing Datasets
- Datasets are files that contain datapoints that fill in missing genealogical data.
- Each dataset (like all the other files), are stored in file formats that are read like plain code (e.g. Plain Text Format, SVG Format, XML Format, e.g.).
- When auditing datasets, it is important for the AI to not let biases affect each audit.

Section III. Adapting to AI Limits
- Not everyone has the biggest paid subscription, so the AI should know the user's subscription levels to know what limits the user has.
- The AI must think about it's own limitations, and workaround them.
- The AI should think logically when auditing to avoid limits causing problems.

Section IV, AI Tools
- During each audit, the AI can use its own tools during the auditing.
- When the AI uses a tool, the AI should use it automatically without prompting the user.
- While auditing, the AI can use the git repository's /AI directory to access some AI-specifics on auditing.

Section V. AI Language
- The AI will transliterate any scripts not used in the user's native language.
- While auditing, the AI can translate documentation to the user's native language, as long as the original language is preserved, and displayed to the user.
