Finn (Fin 1096, 1146, 1152; gen. Finnes 1068 etc.), king of Friesland
PERSONS AND PALACES 145
(1126), son of Folcwalda (1089); his queen is Hildeburh. The some-
what obscure Finn episode in "Beowulf" ([...]. 1068-1159) is evidently
part of a Finn saga, of which only the merest fragment, called the
Fight at Finnsburg (see Appendix), is extant. Various attempts
have been made to reconstruct the saga from these materials, [...]
Frȳsan (gen. Frēsena 1093, [...]), the Frisians.
There are (1) the North Frisians, the people of Finn (q. v.; 1068 ff.);
(2) the West Frisians, who combined with the Franks and Hugs
against Hygelac (1202 ff., 2912 ff.). The land of the former is called
"Frȳs-land" in [...], that of the latter "Frēs-lond" (pl.) in [...] 2357.
